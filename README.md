🥪 DELI-cious Sandwich Shop CLI



DELI-cious is a terminal-based Java application that simulates a sandwich shop ordering system. It allows users to build their own sandwich from scratch or select from curated signature options. Perfect for demonstrating object-oriented principles, user input handling, and dynamic menu logic in Java.

✨ Features
🥪 Build your own or choose a signature sandwich

📏 Select sandwich size, bread type, and toasting

🍖 Add toppings from multiple categories:

Meats: steak, ham, salami, bacon...

Cheeses: cheddar, swiss, provolone...

Regular toppings: lettuce, tomatoes, peppers...

Sauces: mayo, ranch, vinaigrette...

➕ Option to mark toppings as extra portions

📋 Receipt-style summary of your order at the end

🧠 One Challenge I Faced
One of the main challenges in this project was managing topping validation across multiple user interactions. Initially, topping categories like meats and cheeses were hard-coded in the builder class, making the code repetitive and harder to scale. To solve this, I created a Toppingmenu class to centralize topping definitions. This not only made the validation process cleaner and more consistent but also prepared the codebase for future features like dynamic menu updates or saving user favorites.
